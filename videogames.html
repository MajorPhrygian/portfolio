                <div >Video games are a fascinating collective creative experience. With hundreds of persons working on the same endeavor for years, they are nothing short of modern day cathedrals. </div>
                <div >I am a project manager on Rainbow Six Siege, a first person shooter from Ubisoft that is now in its 8 year of live service. First person shooters are very competitive and sometimes, tempers flare up. Siege had gotten itself an undesirable reputation as having one of the most toxic community around. In the Player Protection cell, we are shifting this narrative by modyfing the game in ways that keep all the excitement, but makes the environment more positive. I'll showcase here some the work we have done.</div>

            Reputation System
        </section>
        <p>Just like the in-game stats collect information regarding your skill at the game through headshot ratio, kill-death ratio, win/loss ratio and the like, the Reputation System aims to form a picture of the player's "fairplayness" through other actions. You can have high standards of fairplay, but be either a very talented or lousy Siege player. It is not causal. </p>

            Commendation System
        </section>
        <p>Promoting positivity is as important, if not more, than addressing toxicity. That is why we recently released the Commendation System, giving players a chance to show their appreciation of their teamates, and even their adversaries.</p>

            Reputation Center

        <p>And all those new system meant a lot of communication needs. Players need to understand what is going on; to understand how they can have agency on these systems. That is why we released the Reputation Center.</p>

            Voice Recording Management
        </section>
        <p>For my first two years in the industry, I was managing all voice recordings and post-production for the whole of Ubisoft. Think booking sessions in studios around the world and managing a team of in-house and freelance, post-prod technicians.</p>
